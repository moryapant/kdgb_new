# KDGB Website Redesign Implementation Guide

This document provides instructions for implementing the new website design for KDGB Vidhyavriddhi Samaj.

## New Files Structure

The new design uses a modern, responsive approach with separate CSS and JavaScript files:

```
kdgb/
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   └── main.js
├── images/
├── new-index.html
├── new-donation.html
├── new-contact.html
└── [existing files...]
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Review the new files**:
   - `new-index.html`: Modern, responsive version of the homepage
   - `new-donation.html`: Template for the donation page
   - `new-contact.html`: Modern contact page with form
   - `css/styles.css`: All styling for the new design
   - `js/main.js`: JavaScript functionality for the new design

2. **Move images to organized folders**:
   - Create an `images` folder if it doesn't already exist
   - Move all image files to appropriate subfolders (e.g., `images/logo/`, `images/banner/`)

3. **Implement the new design**:
   - Option 1: Replace the current files with the new ones (after backing up)
   - Option 2: Use the new files as references to update the existing files

4. **Apply the template to all pages**:
   - Use `new-donation.html` as a template for other content pages
   - Update content in each page while maintaining the new structure

5. **Test the website**:
   - Test all pages on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
   - Ensure all links work correctly
   - Check all forms and interactive elements

## Key Improvements

The new design includes several improvements:

1. **Responsive Design**: 
   - The website now works well on all device sizes
   - Mobile-friendly navigation with hamburger menu

2. **Modern Layout**:
   - Clean, organized structure
   - Proper spacing and typography

3. **Better Accessibility**:

5. **Enhanced Features**:

## Customization

You can easily customize the design by:
